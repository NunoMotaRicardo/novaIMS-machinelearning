    "## Group Project\n",
    "* This is a group project due on 08/01/2026\n",
    "* Groups should have 3-5 members each.\n",
    "* All projects should be completed using Jupyter notebooks which will be delivered at the end of the project. Each task should have an independent jupyter notebook, to assist in the grading.\n",
    "* Please read the instructions as you also need to deliver a video.\n",

    "### Project Context\n",
    "Home Credit is a financial services company that provides loans to customers often underserved by traditional banking institutions. The goal is to use machine learning to assess the risk of default at the loan application stage, enabling better decision-making and optimized loan offerings. Understanding which customers are likely to default is crucial for reducing financial losses and improving operational efficiency.\n",
    "### Project data\n",
    "You have access to the Home Credit Default Risk dataset, along with a data dictionary to help you understand the column titles. However, you will need to explore the data yourself—not all columns will be useful, and some may require significant preprocessing. Your tasks will include:\n",
    "* Cleaning the data (e.g., handling null values, resolving data type issues, addressing outliers).\n",
    "* Dealing with categorical variables and feature engineering.\n",
    "* Exploring which features are useful for predictive tasks and avoiding features that may leak data.\n",
    "### Computation\n",
    "Dealing with computation constraints is a big part of machine learning, especially as we start to deal with real world data. If at any point you are trying to run an algorithm or approach that is taking a long time to solve on google colab you have a couple of options:\n",
    "* You can try running it on your laptop directly, in case your laptop or computer is faster.\n",
    "* You can try to reduce the complexity of the model.\n",
    "* You can reduce the complexity of the data by reducing the number of columns you use at a time.\n",
    "* You can just take a smaller sample of the data (less rows) and apply the algorithm / model to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grading\n",
    "* Important you will mostly be graded on your ability to apply the machine learning approaches we have learned in class properly. So please include the work that you test and not just the final best model.\n",
    "* You might receive extra points for demonstrating the ability to apply approaches not covered in the class.\n",
    "* What your final model is (and how well it performs) matters much less than your ability to correctly apply different approaches, explore the problem, and understand the final results and model. Please try to demonstrate in the notebooks and the video.\n",
    "* Well organized Jupyter notebooks and code will help ensure that your intentions are communicated and are likely to increase your \n"
