    "## Individual project - House Price Prediction\n",
    "This is an individual project due on the 9Th of February 2026 23:59 (This is latest date I can officially set an assessment deadline).\n",
    "All projects should be completed using Jupyter notebooks which will be delivered at the end of the project. \n",
    "### Project Context\n",
    "The real estate market is a dynamic and complex sector of the economy, influenced by numerous factors such as location, economic trends, and property characteristics. Accurate house price predictions are crucial for various stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and financial institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features and try to understand the relationships we find. \n",
    "\n",
    "The original data for Ames, Iowa (obtained directly from the Ames Assessor’s Office) is used for tax assessment purposes but lends itself directly to the prediction of home selling prices. The type of information contained in the data is similar to what a typical home buyer would want to know before making a purchase and students should find most variables straightforward and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has provided some challenges for traditional economic methods. You can see a traditional attempt at modelling this data in the below reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pardoe, I. (2008). Modeling home prices using realtor data. Journal of Statistics Education, 16(2), 143. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2008.11889569\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to explore if we can do better with machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT AT ALL STAGES ADD COMMENTS IN NOTEBOOK TO DEMOSNSTRATE YOUR THINKING ON THE DECISION YOU MAKE. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR YOUR GRADE AND IS BEST PRACTICE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "* Important! As you will not provide an explanatory video, please include as much information as possible in the jupyter notebook on what you are trying to do and why and how you interpret the results.\n",
    "* You need to deliver all Jupyter notebooks and code used to complete the projects. You should make use of the markdown cells in the Jupyter notebooks to explain clearly what you are doing in each code cell and why. You should also use these cells to provide your answers to the questions such as showing which is your best classifier and how you decide it was best. Jupyter notebooks should be “solved” so I can see the results of running the code without having to run it myself.\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "* Important you will mostly be graded on your ability to apply the machine learning approaches we have learned in class properly. So please include the work that you test and not just the final best model. Try to apply as much of what we have learned as possible.\n",
    "* You might receive extra points for demonstrating the ability to apply approaches not covered in the class.\n",
    "* What your final model is (and how well it performs) matters much less than your ability to correctly apply different approaches, explore the problem, and understand the final results and model. Please try to demonstrate in the notebooks and the video.\n",
    "* Well organized Jupyter notebooks and code will help ensure that your intentions are communicated and are likely to increase your grade.\n",
